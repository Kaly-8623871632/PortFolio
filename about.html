    <h5><span>About Us</span></h5> 
    <p>My name is Wable Kalyani Sanjay, and I hail from the charming town of Baramati, nestled in the heart of Pune.
      Currently, I find myself residing in Pune due to my pursuit of higher education.
      I am a graduate of B.Sc. Computer Science from the esteemed Savitribai Phule Pune University (SPPU).
      Presently, I am furthering my academic journey at Abasaheb Garware College, Pune.</p>

    <p>In my journey so far, I have embraced challenges as opportunities for growth,
      and I am dedicated to continually expanding my knowledge and skills in the field of computer science.
      I am passionate about leveraging technology to make meaningful contributions to society.</p>

    <p>One guiding principle that resonates deeply with me is, "Success is not the key to happiness;
      rather, happiness is the key to success. If you love what you are doing, you will be successful."
      With this philosophy as my compass, I navigate through life with optimism, resilience, and a steadfast commitment to excellence.</p>

    <p>Thank you for taking the time to learn a bit about me. I look forward to the adventures that lie
      ahead and the opportunities to make a positive impact in the world.</p>
